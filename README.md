# free-marker-alert
HTML template developed using FreeMarker Java Template Engine.


Goal: To speed up and streamline the HTML email production of Alerts and limit the need for after hour and weekend coverage.

Summary:  After an hour review of a previous template developed by a former employee and reading through FreeMarker documentation, production on template commenced. I would estimate it took about about a month or two to develop and test.
